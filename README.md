# WorldWise Single Page Application (REACT + Vite):

WorldWise is a single-page application built using React that aims to provide users with information about different cities around the world. It utilizes various React hooks such as useCallback, useReducer, useState, and useEffect to manage state and side effects efficiently. The application also incorporates protected routes to ensure secure access to certain features.

## Features

- **React Hooks:** WorldWise utilizes React hooks extensively, including useCallback, useReducer, useState, and useEffect, to manage state and side effects in a functional and efficient manner.

- **Protected Routes:** Certain routes within the application are protected, requiring authentication or authorization to access specific features or content.

- **Data Fetching:** The application fetches data from a fake API to populate information about various cities. This data is then displayed to users in an organized and user-friendly format.

- **Integration with Leaflet:** WorldWise leverages the Leaflet library to provide interactive maps and geolocation features, enhancing the user experience and providing visual representations of city locations.

- **Code Splitting:** To optimize the bundle size of the application, WorldWise implements lazy loading using the lazy package along with Suspense components. This ensures that only the necessary code is loaded when required, reducing initial loading times and improving overall performance.



## Dependencies

WorldWise relies on the following dependencies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: A routing library for React applications, used for defining and navigating between different routes.
- Leaflet: An open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps, integrated into the application for displaying city locations.
- Lazy: A utility for lazy loading components in React applications, used for optimizing bundle size and improving performance.
